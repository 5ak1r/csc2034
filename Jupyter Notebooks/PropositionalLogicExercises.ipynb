    "# Translating English Sentences into Propositional Logic Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook was adapted from Peter Norvig (https://github.com/norvig/). The intention here is to remind us what Propositional Logic statements look like, how to construct them, and what the common mathematical symbols mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A *proposition* is a statement about the world that is either true or false. Propositions are typically represented by uppercase Latin letters; the letter P is commonly used for the first proposition in a statement, Q the second, and so on. Proposition can be cominbed with a set of basic rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every propositional symbol and truth value is a sentence **P, Q**\n",
    "- The negation (not) of a sentence is a sentence: **¬P**, **¬false**\n",
    "- The conjunction (and) of two sentences is a sentence: **P ⋀ ¬Q**\n",
    "- The disjunction (or) of two sentences is a sentence: **P ⋁ ¬Q**\n",
    "- The implication (implies) of two sentences is a sentence: **P ⇒ ¬Q**\n",
    "- The equivalence of two sentences is a sentence: **P ⋁ Q ≡ R**\n",
    "\n",
    "A common exercise in learning logic is to turn an English sentence like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Sieglinde will survive, and either her son will gain the Ring and Wotan’s plan will be fulfilled or else Valhalla will be destroyed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "into a formal Propositional Logic statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "    P ⋀ ((Q ⋀ R) ⋁ S)\n",
    "    \n",
    "along with definitions of the propositions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P: Sieglinde will survive\n",
    "    Q: Sieglinde’s son will gain the Ring\n",
    "    R: Wotan’s plan will be fulfilled\n",
    "    S: Valhalla will be destroyed\n",
    "\n",
    "For some sentences, it takes detailed knowledge to get a good translation. The following two sentences are ambiguous, with different prefered interpretations, and translating them correctly requires knowledge of eating habits:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I will eat salad or I will eat bread and I will eat butter.     P ∨ (Q ⋀ R)\n",
    "    I will eat salad or I will eat soup  and I will eat ice cream. (P ∨ Q) ⋀ R\n",
    "\n",
    "But for many sentences, the translation process is automatic, with no special knowledge required. The following is programmme to handle these easy sentences. The programme is based on the idea of a series of translation rules of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rule('{P} ⇒ {Q}', 'if {P} then {Q}', 'if {P}, {Q}')\n",
    "    \n",
    "which means that the logic translation will have the form `'P ⇒ Q'`, whenever the English sentence has either the form `'if P then Q'` or  `'if P, Q'`, where `P` and `Q` can match any non-empty subsequence of characters.  Whatever matches `P` and `Q` will be recursively processed by the rules. The rules are in order&mdash;top to bottom, left to right, and the first rule that matches in that order will be accepted, no matter what, so be sure you order your rules carefully. One guideline adhered to is to put all the rules that start with a keyword (like `'if'` or `'neither'`) before the rules that start with a variable (like `'{P}'`); that way you avoid accidently having a keyword swallowed up inside a `'{P}'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that given the sentence \"*Sieglinde will survive*\", the program should make up a new propositional symbol, `P`, and record the fact that `P` refers to \"*Sieglinde will survive*\". But the negative sentence \"*Sieglinde will not survive*\", should be translated as `～P`, where again `P` is  \"*Sieglinde will survive*\". So to fully specify the translation process, we need to define both `rules` and `negations`. (We do that using [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/re.html), which can sometimes be confusing.)\n",

    "# Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some limitations with the above implementation; there are likely to be many more:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Should I stay` *etc.*:<br>questions are not poropositional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `If I were a carpenter`:<br>doesn't handle modal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `nothing is better`:<br>doesn't handle quantifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Either Wotan will triumph and Valhalla will be saved or else he won't`:<br>gets `'he will'` as one of the propositions, but better would be if that refered back to `'Wotan will triumph'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Wotan will intervene and cause Siegmund's death`:<br>gets `\"cause Siegmund's death\"` as a proposition, but better would be `\"Wotan will cause Siegmund's death\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Figaro and Susanna will wed`:<br>gets `\"Figaro\"` and `\"Susanna will wed\"` as two separate propositions; this should really be one proposition. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"either Antonio or Figaro pays\"`:<br>gets `\"Antonio\"` as a proposition, but it should be `\"Antonio pays\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `If the Kaiser neither prevents`:<br>uses the somewhat bogus propositions `PQ` and `PR`. This should be done in a cleaner way. The problem is the same as the previous problem with Antonio: I don't have a good way to attach the subject of a verb phrase to the multiple parts of the verb/object, when there are multiple parts."
