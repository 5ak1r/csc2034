Stam (2003) is a paper that attempts to emphasise the importance of effectively visualising fluid flows in video games. It discusses the numerical methods, mathematical equations and algorithms that Stam uses to provide a simple, yet complete implementation of a basic fluid velocity solver. Stam uses fundamental fluid dynamic concepts such as the Navier-Stokes equations, which are not normally used in physically accurate solvers. Also unlike past solvers, Stam's prioritises visual quality, stability and speed, while ensuring the fluids still appear realistic and convincing. Stam encourages the importance of making a successful fluid flow solver that is lightweight and simple; being implementable on standard PCs and consoles.

Although research into fluid dynamics for video games and ad-hoc methods already existed, Stam describes them as "fake" and difficult to animate. Stam wanted to address the challenges of more realistic implementations by providing an elementary and efficient alternative, one that focuses entirely on balancing speed with high quality visual simulation. They do this through the development of custom algorithms, using the physical principles of fluid dynamics. This is unlike pre-existing methods, that usually strive for accuracy in exchange for high complexity and time consumption. The main goal is to improve player immersion when it comes to common fluids present in games, such as smoke drifting from a campfire.

Stam uses well-established physics principles and mathematical equations, to create a custom solver that prioritises visual quality, stability and speed. The Navier-Stokes equations are a precise model for most fluid flows occuring in nature, making them a great tool to base Stam's custom algorithm on. Stam begins by using their previous research, Stam (1997), where they developed a stable density solver, used to move density fields through kinetic turbulent wind fields. Due to the similarities of the Navier-Stokes equation for density moving through a velocity field and the equation for the velocity, there was a seamless transition from their previous solver into a fluid velocity solver.

Stam states that they have written many versions of the solver and various demos and prototypes. They also provide snapshots of their demos in the paper; some that were shown at a conference during a talk they gave about their findings. It is safe to assume that they believe their research was successful. This is further reinforced by the experiments they conducted, involving a book called "An Album of Fluid Motion" by Van Dyke. The results of this experiment compared favorably with the visuals of real flows provided in the book. Furthermore, they did great work later on in the development of modeling and animation software for MAYA.

The results are interpreted in a very straightforward manner. They relate to the original problem of providing an efficient visualisation of fluid flows for video games. Furthermore, the additional work described, that resulted in the successful development of fluid effects for MAYA, further emphasises their achievement. A logical interpretation is almost guaranteed to arise given the simplicity of the task defined for themselves; to create a simple and lightweight solver. Although the paper does not explicitly state faults or flaws, it gives a lot of ideas on how to further improve the simple example provided. It is essential to note that the algorithm meets the predefined requirements as is.

With over 400 citations, it is a sensible assumption that Stam has made a significant contribution to the area of fluid dynamics for not just video games, but other areas of computing too. An example of this would be in Morris et al. (2006), where they use Stam's findings to aid in simulating bone surgery for training and evaluation, using Eulerian methods similar to Stam. Furthermore, Stam uses their own research in future work (Stam, 2004), where they explore the simulation and control of physical phenomena in computer graphics. Additionally, the MAYA Fluid Effects feature for modeling and animation software is a functional, successful culmination of this research.

Stam (2003) is a paper that presents a simple and fast implementation of a fluid dynamnics solver, primary aimed at game engines. As such, it prioritises visual quality, speed and stability over physical accuracy. This is unlike existing applications as their algorithms prioritise accuracy, at the expense of being more complex and time consuming; not recommended for video games. Stam emphasises the importance of developing a successful fluid velocity solver to enhance player immersion, given the abundance of fluid flows in games, such as "swirling smoke past a moving character". Stam talks about the initial work of creating a density solver, due to the similarity of the density and velocity equations written by Navier and Stokes, allowing methods created for it to be seamlessly reused in the fluid velocity solver. There is a clear explanation of the processes used and the mathematical theory behind the code produced, separated into small, comprehensible chunks. Overall, it is simple to follow and accessible to those with little knowledge of the theory behind fluid dynamics. However, without the written explanations, the code itself is very difficult to interpret. Variable names are not well-defined, usually a single letter and sometimes a number, so there is significantly reduced readability. Stam's findings and results are in line with their initial goal; they successfully produced and explained a fluid velocity solver that was fast and visually precise when compared to fluids presented in Van Dyke's book. Additionally, although Stam agrees that the solver given is not perfect, it satisfies the predefined requirements of effiency. There is a prudent collection of improvements and extensions that can be made to further enhance the solver, as well as ways to alter the existing functionality of boundaries. The images provided are relevant and aid in improving the reader's understanding of the topics described.
