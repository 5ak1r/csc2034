The results are interpreted in a very straightforward manner. They relate to the original problem of providing an efficient visualisation of fluid flows for video games. Furthermore, the additional work described, that resulted in the successful development of fluid effects for MAYA, further emphasises their achievement. A logical interpretation is almost guaranteed to arise given the simplicity of the task defined for themselves; to create a simple and lightweight solver. Although the paper does not explicitly state faults or flaws, it gives a lot of ideas on how to further improve the simple example provided. It is essential to note that the algorithm meets the predefined requirements as is.
